## LeetCode 004 Median of Two Sorted Arrays
# 使用求第K小的数的方法求解 以达到时间要求
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
